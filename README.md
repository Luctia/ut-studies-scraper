# UT Studies scraper
This (not yet implemented) application is meant to be put on a server which will check available resources to view if the information on [this projects main repository](https://github.com/Luctia/ut-studies) is still up-to-date.

## Resources
This application will use a large number of resources. The following list is what the current list is made up of:
- [The Dutch CROHO registry](https://duo.nl/zakelijk/hoger-onderwijs/studentenadministratie/opleidingsgegevens-in-croho/raadplegen-en-downloaden.jsp)
- [The UT's abbreviation list](https://www.utwente.nl/en/mc/abc-attachments/ml/abbreviation-list/)
- The UT's website containing studies and their descriptions
  - [Bachelor](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/)
  - [Master](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/)

## Application
The way this application will be implemented is not yet clear. Its task is currently performed by a human.
